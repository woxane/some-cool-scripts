# pac-aria2c
i have problem for upgrading with pacman in speed test , i had soo fucking bad internet speed while upgrading ( but i have good internet speed in another 3rd party application) . soo i use this script to save my time .      
Special thanks to [AmirKh20](https://github.com/AmirKh20) for helping me . 

### Important Things 
First Things create directory for all downloads save there (they are delete after installtion) , i create the direcotry with name : .pacman-aria2c-upgrade . if you want another name change it but also change code .       
i paste the code in my shell config file(~/.zshrc) you can use it everywhere like you PATH or config file and bluh bluh bluh .      
For finding PATH address , run this in your terminal :       
	
	echo $PATH
