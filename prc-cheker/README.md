This is some random shit that can help you when you working with terminal ! 
does it happen to you , that you can't CTRL + C a process and you must to use CTRL + Z and this suspend (when imposter is SUS) your process and you must type kill %1 to kill (bang bang !) your process .

## Get started 
Ok , This is soo easy , dont act like idiot . you must just copy this file and print it in your shell config file . my shell is zsh and the config file is in the ~/.zshrc . if you dont know where is the config file , you can use google , and if you dont know what is your shell name , you can type this command in terminal : 

	echo $SHELL 
And search google where is your shell config file .
