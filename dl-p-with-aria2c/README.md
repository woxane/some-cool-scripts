Does is sometimes happend to you , that your internet speed for downloading or update for pacman is slow but you have good internet speed in another downloader is soo fast . my script that have good speed is aria2c and i use it in the script (you can change what you like) .              
Special thanks to [Amirkh20](https://github.com/AmirKh20) to helping me for this .

### Important Things 
First of all is you must create a directory where you want to downloads the files and my direcotry name is .aria2c-package-downloads but you must make it and use the script . 
And i use this code in my shell config(~/.zshrc) , but you can save it in your PATH file .         
you can find the PATH addresss like this .         
	
	echo $PATH
