# Roza
Roza is script that you can use it to convert youre chat into beautiful one .

old one : 

Hello boy , what's u doing ? 

With Roza : 

Hello boy , what's u doing ? :>

Maby your chat is beautiful , but with Roza you can set shortcut for script and easily use them . 
### Get started : 
-1 first of all you must set your emoji face into 'data_file.txt' (you can put anything in the data_file) if you dont want , i put some of my most lovely emoji face :') . 

-2 create shortcut for it . if you are using kde plasama , [this link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/90567/quickly-launch-any-app-in-kde-with-a-shortcut) can help you to create shortcut for run command . 

-3 done ! . you can use it . easy right ?
### Maby you ask : 
-1 Why i must create shortcut for run command , if i can create shortcut for the script ? :

i must say the script run like this : 

	python3 printer.py 1 

and that write your first line of your 'data_file.txt' . 

and this : 

	python3 printer.py 2 

and that wwrite your second line . 

this is why you must create shortcut for run command :)
